# Filmstrip

The Filmstrip unit template offers 3 kinds of experience in one ad: Image Gallery, Video Gallery, Content Panel.
In the code, due to the fixed header and footer of the unit, it is separated a little differently.

##  init_header()

In this section, we initialize the header or top content of the unit. 
First we lay out the labels or titles for each section.
Then we add `MOUSE_DOWN` events to the `up_arrow` and the `down_arrow`.
